Tic Tac Toe
This is a Java implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns placing their marks (X or O) until one player gets three in a row.

Getting Started
To run the game, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to a local directory.

To run the game, navigate to the directory where you saved the files and run the following command:

Copy code
java TicTacToe
The game will start in the console window.

How to Play
To make a move, enter the row (0-2) and column (0-2) where you want to place your mark when prompted by the game. The first player is X and the second player is O.

The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a tie).
