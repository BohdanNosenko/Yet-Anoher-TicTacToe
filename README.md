## Tic Tac Toe

This is a Java implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns placing their marks (X or O) until one player gets three in a row.

# Getting Started

To run the game, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the [**official website**](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

Once you have Java installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BohdanNosenko/Yet-Anoher-TicTacToe.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file and extract it to a local directory.

To run the game, navigate to the directory where you saved the files and run the following command:

```bash
java TicTacToe
```

The game will start in the console window.

# How to Play
To make a move, enter the row (0-2) and column (0-2) where you want to place your mark when prompted by the game. The first player is X and the second player is O.

The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a tie).

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! I'm just learning Java and if you have any suggestions or improvements for the game, feel free to submit a pull request.
